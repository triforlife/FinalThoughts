  I thought go was an interesting choice to do web pages with but, I dont know
  php either, so, it really didnt matter to me.  I think that Todd was very 
  enthusiastic and very motivated to teach us everyday and, I appreciate that.
  Overall this class was fun and interesting.  I learned alot about building
  web sites and programming html, css and go.
